      <p>I'm a 21-year-old... uhhh- I really have no idea. My parents let me use a computer when I was 4, so it was before these were designed purely for consumption and giving us dopamine addiction. This essentially means that I'm quite knowledgeable with them.</p>
      <p>I've been daily driving Linux for many years now and I can work with it in both desktop and server scenarios. I have distrohopped very often from the most popular distros to complete niches. I also tried OpenBSD (and it was quite nice!). For now I settled on NixOS-unstable which is basically perfect for me and if you install it in an ephemeral configuration - you get a clean, untouched environment on every reboot which I feel like is the distrohopper dream :)</p>
      <p>While I can code and sometimes do it when I have to - I don't really like doing it. WebDev however sounds very cool for me, I just never really researched how it's done today, so for now I get satisfaction from writing this thing manually.</p>
      <p>My hobbies and interests would include cybersecurity, OSINT, some public transport and generally urbanism (but I live in a small village so can't do much here ꃋᴖꃋ). I also research lots of psychology and neurobiology related topics. I've been also playing Minecraft for 12 years now and somehow I didn't get bored of it yet, I still haven't killed the ender dragon though.</p>
      <p>If you want to shit-talk someone, waste my time in the weirdest ways possible or start suffering from unimaginable amounts of mental illnesses, feel free to DM me! <sub>if u want to do pgp memery then please use signify/age instead (github url + .keys to get pubkeys)</sub></p>
